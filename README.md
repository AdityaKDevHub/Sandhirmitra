# संधिर्मित्र (Sandhirmitra)
> ## Introduction
> One of my first major Python projects. \
> One of the fundamental aspects of the Sanskrit language is संधि (Sandhi), which allows the joining of two Sanskrit words based on their first and last characters. \
> Automation is the present meta amongst programmers. Hence, संधिर्मित्र  is a classic algorithm that joins Sanskrit words provided by the user. It supports स्वरसंधि (Swar Sandhi), व्यञ्जनसंधि (Vyanjan Sandhi) and विसर्गसंधि (Visargh Sandhi).
